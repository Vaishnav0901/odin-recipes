HTML Foundation project for the Odin Project. This would be a simple HTML 
website (without CSS) with an index page and certain other hyperlinked 
pages talking about Recipes (ah I love Food)

This project would equip me to apply the concepts learned during the 
course on HTML,usage of  Git,  GitHub,  VSCodePro, Terminal amongst others
