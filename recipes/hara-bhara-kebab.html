    <h3> <Strong> How to make Hariyali Kebab  </Strong> </h3>
    <ol>
        
    
        <li> <strong> <em> Grind the soaked chana dal and prepare kebab dough </em> </strong> </li>
        <p> Soak the chana dal for at least 4 hours before cooking. Grind the soaked chana dal to a smooth paste along with blanched spinach leaves, coriander, salt and green chillies. Take it out in a bowl and mix with the rest of the ingredients except oil and cashews. </p> 
        
        <li> <strong> <em> Form the kebabs and fry them </em> </strong> </li>
        <p>  Now, you should have a dough-like mixture with you. Make some small balls out of it and give them the shape of kebabs. Press half a cashew on top of each kebab. Meanwhile, put a tawa on medium flame and apply some oil in it. When all the kebabs are made, place them on the hot tawa and pan fry until golden brown from both sides. Serve with your favourite chutney.        </p>
